# Blender4dsTools
This addon aims to bring Mafia 4ds models into Blender!

## Facts about the project
- Initial project was started by Sevenisko built upon and improved by Richard01_CZ
- Project is being created with the use of AI such as Google AI Studio, Grok, ChatGPT
- This project can only exist thanks to some already created open-source 4ds plugins and parsers for different 3D model editors and programms
- Project is currently only being developed by me alone
- One of the main goals of this 4ds addon is the ease of use (if you know how to use blender of course)

WIP

Main used sources by the AI:
Max4dsTools, FireModelka, BlenderMafia4ds, mafia-formats
and more.

_current public 4ds addon is outdated and doesn't include latest improvements_
